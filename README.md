# Assignment 3 - Process XML with JavaScript

Fix the error in the code by changing the file ``lib/assignment.js``.
Don't change any other files! Use the command ``npm install && npm test``
to run the tests.  You are done when the command displays:

        test
        ✔ xml transform sample1
        ✔ xml transform sample2

        OK: 2 assertions (40ms)

Then commit your changes and generate a patch:

        git format-patch origin/master
